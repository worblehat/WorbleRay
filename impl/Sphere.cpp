     * An intersection between a ray and sphere can be described by two different formulas, which
     * are therefore equivalent:
     * Ray.origin + t * Ray.direction = Sphere.center + q
     * where q is a vector from the spheres center to the sphere surface with length = Sphere.radius
     * This forumla can be rearranged to a quadratic equation for t:
     * a * t² + b * t + c = 0
     * where
     * a = Ray.direction * Ray.direction    (if direction is normalized: a = 1)
     * b = 2 * Ray.direction * (Ray.origin - Sphere.center)
     * c = (Ray.origin - Sphere.center) * (Ray.origin - Sphere.center) - (Sphere.radius)^2
     * Solving the quation for t yields:
     * t = (-b +- sqrt(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
     * Only the following part is interesting in order to determine how many intersection points
     * exist:
     * d = b² - 4ac
     * d < 0: no intersection
     * d = 0: one intersection
     * d > 0: two intersections
     * Only if d >= 0 we need to calculate t to check if the ray starts before, inside or after the
     * sphere.
